- Restoration
A good way to pause one thing, do another and then come back again, but there are quite a lot of disadvantages, such as that the fresource should be easily taken away from the process, it is possible external interference,and everything depends on the nature of the resource.

- Prevention
Deadlock prevention ensures that at least one of the necessary conditions to cause a deadlock will never occur. This strategy is good, because the system does not require information of the existing resources, resource availability and resource requests

- Avoidance
Deadlock avoidance ensures that the system will not enter an unsafe state. For deadlock avoidance we use Bankerâ€™s and Safety algorithm for resource allocation purpose. This strategy is good, because with such algrorith we will never have a situation when system will get deadlock
